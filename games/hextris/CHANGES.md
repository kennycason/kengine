# Hextris Piece Rotation Fixes

## Issue Description

Some pieces in the Hextris game were not rotating correctly. After a rotation, some pieces would appear to be "messed up" or "inverted", and then would fix themselves after a second 90-degree rotation, only to become incorrect again after the next rotation.

## Root Cause

The Hextris game implements piece rotation by pre-defining 4 rotation states for each piece type (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). When a piece is rotated, the game simply switches to the next rotation state in the sequence.

However, some pieces had incorrectly defined rotation states that did not represent proper 90-degree rotations of each other. This caused pieces to appear to change shape or "invert" when rotated.

## Changes Made

The following pieces had their rotation states corrected to ensure proper 90-degree rotations:

1. **J Piece (L-backwards)**
   - Fixed the second rotation state which was incorrectly defined
   - Corrected the fourth rotation state to ensure proper 90-degree rotation
   - Added comments to clarify the expected shape of each rotation state

2. **Y Piece**
   - Corrected all rotation states to ensure proper 90-degree rotations
   - Added comments to clarify the expected shape of each rotation state (pointing up, right, down, left)

3. **BIG_L_BACKWARDS Piece**
   - Fixed inconsistent rotation states
   - Added ASCII art comments to clarify the expected shape of each rotation state

4. **SMALL_L Piece**
   - Fixed the fourth rotation state which was incorrectly defined as identical to the first state
   - Updated it to be a proper 90-degree rotation of the third state (pointing up)

## Implementation Details

For each piece, we ensured that:
1. Each rotation state is a proper 90-degree rotation of the previous state
2. The sequence of rotations forms a complete 360-degree cycle
3. The piece maintains its shape throughout all rotations

We added detailed comments to clarify the expected shape of each rotation state, making it easier to verify the correctness of the rotations.

## Expected Impact

These changes should fix the rotation issues with the affected pieces. Players should now see consistent and correct 90-degree rotations for all pieces, without any pieces appearing to change shape or "invert" during rotation.

## Mathematical Rotation Implementation

After fixing the manual rotation states, we switched to a **mathematical rotation approach** for several reasons:

### Benefits of Mathematical Rotation:
1. **Cleaner code** - No need to manually define 4 rotation states for each piece type
2. **Less error-prone** - No risk of defining incorrect rotation states
3. **Supports RANDOM pieces** - Can rotate any arbitrary shape correctly
4. **Easier to maintain** - Single base shape definition per piece

### Implementation:
Each piece now stores only its base shape, and rotations are calculated mathematically:
- **Clockwise 90°**: `(x, y) → (-y, x)`
- **Counterclockwise 90°**: `(x, y) → (y, -x)`  
- **180°**: `(x, y) → (-x, -y)`

### Code Reduction:
- Before: 28 pieces × 4 rotation states = **112 shape definitions**
- After: 28 pieces × 1 base shape = **28 shape definitions**
- **75% reduction in code** with better correctness guarantees!
